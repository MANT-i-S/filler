# filler

__Created bot for the logic game (implemented heat-map-based algorithm). The main goal of a game to place on the map as many pieces provided by virtual machine. Pieces should be placed to overlap only one square of your previous placements. My algorithm heading to the opponent's field right away and surrounding it to prevent any valid move in the future.__
